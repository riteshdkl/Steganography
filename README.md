# Steganography Project

## What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. It allows secret communication without drawing attention to the hidden content.

## Why Use Steganography?
Unlike traditional cryptography, which makes the message obvious but encrypted, steganography is more discreet. The hidden message does not attract attention, making it ideal for sending confidential information safely. Additionally, the hidden message can often be extracted more easily.
